# Competitive Eating Competition Scoreboard

This project implements a function to generate a scoreboard for a competitive eating competition. Participants are scored based on the number of chicken wings, hamburgers, and hotdogs they consume, with each food item worth a different number of points.

## Functionality

The `create_scoreboard()` function takes a list of participant objects as input, where each participant object includes their name and the quantities of chicken wings, hamburgers, and hotdogs they consumed. The function calculates the total score for each participant based on the points assigned to each food item and returns a scoreboard sorted by score in descending order. If scores are equal, participants are sorted alphabetically by name.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository git
2. Import the 'create_scoreboard()' function into your code :from scoreboard import create_scoreboard
3.Define a list of participant objects with their names and food quantities
